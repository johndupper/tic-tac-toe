# tic-tac-toe
This is a simple tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. (+1 for the oxford comma?)

I wanted to make as much of this game as possible using standard JavaScript.
I started with a complete HTML body but later opted to learn how to create elements using JS instead.
The functionality of this game relies heavily on if-statements and for-loops.
I used JSLint (for the first time) while making this project.
It was frustrating at first to declare variable before assignment (for example) or beginning each function with 'use strict'.
I've taken time to organize and structure my code in such a way that it would be easy for someone else to read and follow.

If you have any feedback for me -- I would love to hear from you:  dupper.john@gmail.com
